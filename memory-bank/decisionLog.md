[2025-03-27 01:33:02] - Project Template Architecture Decisions

1. Poetry + UV Integration
   Decision: Use Poetry as primary package manager with UV acceleration
   Rationale:

- Poetry provides robust dependency management
- UV offers faster package operations
- Combined approach gives best of both tools
  Impact: Improved development workflow and package installation speed

2. VS Code Profile Structure
   Decision: Create comprehensive VS Code profile with integrated tools
   Rationale:

- Consistent development environment
- Automated code quality checks
- Integrated debugging and testing
  Impact: Standardized development experience across projects

3. CI/CD Pipeline Architecture
   Decision: Multi-stage GitHub Actions workflow
   Rationale:

- Separate test, lint, and deployment stages
- Matrix testing for Python versions
- Automated quality gates
  Impact: Reliable deployment pipeline with quality assurance

4. Project Template Structure
   Decision: Standardized template with pre-configured tools
   Rationale:

- Consistent project setup
- Built-in best practices
- Reduced setup time
  Impact: Faster project initialization with quality standards

5. GitHub Integration
   Decision: Deep VS Code integration with GitHub
   Rationale:

- Seamless workflow between IDE and repository
- Automated CI/CD triggers
- Integrated code review tools
  Impact: Streamlined development workflow

6. Testing Framework
   Decision: pytest with coverage reporting
   Rationale:

- Industry standard testing framework
- Built-in coverage tools
- Rich plugin ecosystem
  Impact: Comprehensive test coverage and reporting

Pending Decisions:

1. Branch protection strategy
2. Code review requirements
3. Release management process
4. Development environment standardization
